# A Roadmap for the Free Insulin Project

## Data needed for approval of interchangeable product

### Biosimilars and interchangeable products
- Analytical studies demonstrating that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components
- Animal studies, including an assessment of toxicity
- Clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biosimilar product in one or more of the indications for which the reference product is licensed. This typically includes assessing immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and, in some cases, pharmacodynamics (PD) and may also include a comparative clinical study.

### Interchangeable products only
- The proposed interchangeable product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient
- For a product administered more than once to an individual, switching between the proposed interchangeable product and the reference product does not increase safety risks or decrease effectiveness compared to using the reference product without such switching between products
